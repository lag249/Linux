#echo will print the first part of the story and then read the user input and store it as a variable called answer. If the user selects A, then the fishing storyline will progress. Else- the wildlife storyline will progres. Fi ends the first if, then, else statement

echo "It was 10 o'clock in the morning and already 100 degrees outside. Brian's grandfather would be arriving soon to spend the day with him. Brian's grandfather hated to sit around the house all day so Brian knew he had to think of something fun to do to pass the time. Brian loved to fish and there was a watering hole right down the street where they could fish and stay cool. Brian's grandfather loved animals and there was also an animal refuge in town that Brian had never visited. Should Brian and his grandfather go fishing or see the animals? Type A for fishing and B for the refuge."

read answer

#below is an if statement that says if the input that is read is equal to "A", then the storyline about Brian and his grandfather going fishing will continue. If the selection "B" is typed, the program will read it as "else" and the storyline about Brian and his grandfather going to the animal refuge will continue. Whichever option is selected will lead to additional choices which will ask for user input using the read command.

if [ "$answer" == "A" ]
then
	echo "Brian's grandfather was happy to hear that he and Brian would spend the day fishing. He had stopped at the general store on his way over to buy soda pop and penny candy. They could sit on the large rocks and fish for trout. It was sure to be shadier there by the watering hole and they may get a nice break from the heat. Brian's grandfather wanted to know whether Brian wanted to dig for worms to use as bait or drive to the store to buy some nightcrawlers. Type C if Brian wants to dig for worms, and D if he'd rather drive to the store."

else
	echo "Brian's grandfather loved wildlife. He was excited that Brian wanted to spend the day at the animal refuge. There were coyotes and turkeys and all types of local wildlife that had been rescued to see. Brian's grandfather asked Brian if he wanted to pack a picnic to bring or stop at the diner down the road on the way to see the animals. Type E to pack a picnic and F to stop at the diner."

fi

#In the storyline whatever choice is chosen gives new answer options stored as variable $answerb. The read command takes the option for $answerb and then an if, then, else statement is used. I added the elif (else if) command because I had multiple conditions for the variable $answerb. For the script below, if the first test is false, then it continues to check the other "if" conditions.

read answerb 

if [ "$answerb" == "C" ]
then
	echo "Great! Let's dig for worms"
elif [ "$answerb" == "D" ] 
then
	echo "Hop in the car, let's go get some worms."
elif [ "$answerb" == "E" ]
then
	echo "I love a picnic. Let's see what's in the fridge."
else
	echo "That diner has the best sandwiches. Let's go see what is on special today."
fi
