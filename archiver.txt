#Below is !/bin/bash which is needed to run the script 

#!/bin/bash

#Below is an in, then else statement that asks if the positional parameter of a file is less than 1. If it is, an error will display alerting that more input is needed and prompting someone to enter input. The input is then read and stored as a variable. Else, if the file exists it is stored as the first commmand-line argument passed, or positional parameter #1. Fi signifies 
the end of the if, then else script.

if [ $# -lt 1 ]
then 
	echo "More input is needed."
	echo "Type filename"
	read filename
else 
	filename=$1
fi

#Below I used echo to print a message that tells the user that the script is checking to see if the file exists, and then to print the filename out for a visual.

echo "checking if file exists..."
echo "$filename"

#Below is an if then, else statement that checks to see if there is a file with the filename that matches the variable filename. If there is, then echo prints a message that says that the file exists. If the file exists, the tar command creates an archive of the file. Then else says if the file does not exist echo should print a message that says create file. Then the touch command will create the file, and the ls command will show that the file has been created. Fi signifies the end of that script.


if [ -f $filename ] 
then 
  	echo "file exists"
	tar cvf $filename.tar ./$filename
else
		echo "create file"
		touch $filename
		ls -l $filename
fi
